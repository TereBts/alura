    ![Home Performance Issues](/assets/readme-files/index-performance.png)
    - The performance issues showed render-blocking resources - referring to the CSS and javascript links to Bootstrap, which I ignored as their value far outweighs any minor performance issues. 
    - The other issue was with the image formats, to resolve this issue I converted all images on the website to webp format. 
    ![Home Accessibility Issues](/assets/readme-files/index-accessibility.png)
    - To resolve this issue I altered the nav link colors to white and the active link colour to the highlight-light color.

    ![Invest Best Practices Issues](/assets/readme-files/invest-best-practices.png)
    - The best practices section flagged up the cookies coming from the iframe I am using from Google Maps to show the location of the business. To fix this I could show a screen print of the map that links to it as an outside resource, or I can use a late loading script in javascript that will cause a blurred view of the map until the user interacts with it. As this project is focused on CSS and HTML I decided to leave the map as it was.
