    ![Home Accessibility Issues](/assets/readme-files/index-accessibility.png)
    - To resolve this issue I altered the nav link colors to be white and the active link colour to be the highlight-light color.

    - The best practices section flagged up the cookies coming from the iframe I am using from google maps to show the location of the business. In order to fix this I could show a screen print of the map that links to it as an outside resource, or I can use a late loading script in javascript that will cause a blurred view of the map until the user interacts with it. As this project is focused on CSS and HTML I decided to leave the map as it was.
